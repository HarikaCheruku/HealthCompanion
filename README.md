Abstract
Many people globally face obstacles in accessing healthcare due to factors like location, cost, and a shortage of medical professionals. Misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis is common, leading to ineffective treatments, unnecessary procedures, and patient harm. People often resort to self-diagnosis based on online health information, which can be inaccurate and cause unnecessary anxiety or incorrect treatment choices. Our project offers an innovative solution for symptom analysis and disease prediction by using machine learning algorithms to accurately predict potential diseases based on symptoms given by the user. It provides personalized insights, including disease descriptions, medicines, diets/dietary images, health tips, and first aid steps/precautions. To enhance user interaction language translation, and a speak-aloud are included for the personalised insights, also a chatbot to answer the basic health related queries of user.
